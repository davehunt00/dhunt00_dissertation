Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python code used to simulate foraging patterns on a neutral landscape with a variably-sized patch of fixed resource.  The model allows the user to modulate the directional persistence of the foraging path by use of probability distribution derived from a wrapped Cauchy distribution.
