Overview
This repository contains two sections. 

The CRW folder contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python code used to simulate foraging patterns on a neutral landscape with a variably-sized patch of fixed resource.  The model allows the user to modulate the directional persistence of the foraging path by use of probability distribution derived from a wrapped Cauchy distribution. 

The Discoverability folder contains Excel spreadsheets and Jupyter Notebooks used to calculate
the Discoverability Dlists and Olists used in my dissertation as well as the ArcGIS shapefiles 
for the obsidian and fine-grained volcanic (FGV) toolstone sources used by the earliest people inhabiting the Old River Bed delta in Utah.
